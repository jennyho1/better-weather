# Better Weather

A cosy aesthetic theme weather app that not only displays weather information, but uses that data to calculate what outdoor activity is best suited for these weather conditions. An app that could predict when thereâ€™s going to be a potential beautiful sunset. An app that suggests prime fishing times. These activities are suggested by taking into account rain predictions, cloud coverage, humidity and much more.

It is built with Swift and Xcode. 
We used the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch data about the weather
